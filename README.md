# Space Invaders Clone

A clone of the classic Space Invaders game written in JavaScipt.

The most basic of features have been implemented, however there is a lot to do to make it closer to the original.

## How To Play

Use the arrow keys or A and D keys to move the ship left or right and the space bar or the left mouse button to fire.
