# Space Invaders Clone

A clone of the classic Space Invaders game written in JavaScipt.

The most basic of features have been implemented, however there is a lot to do to make it closer to the original.

## TODO:

- Organize code into different files
- Add intro/menu screen and game over screen
- Add sound effects
- Add different invaders
- Add different levels
- Add different types of shots used by the invaders
- Add UFO
- Add bunkers
- Tweek sprite sizes to match game screen ratio
- Improve fonts to match game
- Animate invaders
- Change invader movement to match the original game
- Add a high score system
- Add styling/graphics around the game screen (e.g. borders, background, etc.)
- Add controller support
